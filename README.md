# Plot.ly Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Summary
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

**The site has the following elements:**

- A test subject drop-down menu that is dynamically populated based upon the sample data;
- A panel and three graphs are dynamically created based upon the subject selected:
  - a demographic panel that lists the subject's information
  - a bar chart that illustrates the ten most prevalent OTU's found for this subject
  - a bubble chart that illustrates the OTUs and their relative sample values
  - a Gauge chart that shows the washing frequency.

This dashboard is hosted here:
